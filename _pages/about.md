Born in Korea, I studied Industrial Engineering & Statistics at Yonsei University. In my undergraduate years, I looked at broad topics: Investments, Computer Science, Consulting, Mathematics, and Statistics. I joined Yonsei Artificial Intelligence Club and did 2 REUs from Dr. Woojoo Kim and Dr. Wonyong Shin. I examined data engineering and deep learning on network data and Korean natural language processing. 

In my senior year, I concluded that statistics is the only and the most potent discipline that could incorporate my knowledge. These personal experiences soon led me to an ambition: I wanted to integrate modern machine learning as a general statistics framework. Please visit my "Research & Presentation" or "Project" if you want to know more.  

I seek advantages from both perspectives: As a Statistician and an Engineer. My loving topics are bayesian probabilistic modeling, variational inference, and deep probabilistic models. 

However, I enjoy talking about literally **every topic**.
