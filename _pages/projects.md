In this project, I worked with the National Institute of Environmental Research (NIER) in Korea to implement geospatial grid algorithms for the Geostationary Environmental Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS).

Our goal is to develop a gridding algorithm, incorporating uncertainty within the algorithm with enhanced efficiency.

I worked with the LG Display team as a researcher of topic modeling-based patent mining. With these skills, I proposed a
business operation based on topic modeling, which was selected for an oral presentation at the 2019 Big Data Contest.

The proposed method incorporates LDA topic modeling and Korean NLP skills. 

## Solving Multi-Modal High-Dimensional Inverse Problems using Partition Flows
<p align="center"><img src="/assets/img/ConditionalSampling.PNG" width="80%" height="60%" title="ATVI Outline" alt="RubberDuck" /></p>


In Many scientific applications, researchers may infer high dimensional data from observable
result with known forward model. Thus, how observed data is determined by unknown true data
is well known. However, the converse is not generally true. Inferring is ambiguous, and this
encounters high-dimensional multi-modal distributions. 

To overcome challenges of the task, I propose a partition flow, which overcomes the limitations of the
traditional methods using deep generative modeling that utilizes sub partitions of the domain.
